# NLP Deep Learning Analysis

Dependencies:
- Python
- Tensorflow 2
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- keras
- sklearn

For preprocessing, run the preprocessing.ipynb file using Python.  
For the actual NLP neural network usage, run:
- RNN.ipynb
- LSTM.ipynb
- GRU.ipynb

With all dependencies installed, any of these should run fine.  
Please note: there originally were *some* instabilities with the GRU and LSTM models with the Resume dataset (the kernel would crash trying to fit them), but it should be stable now.  
On the off chance it isn't or can't be run, please message me or refer to the cell outputs that I've left in the code for your convenience.
